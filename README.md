# Data Science Tools

A collection of tools for conducting data analysis, predictive modeling and
data visualization.

## dstools

Various clustering and regression algorithms, visualization and data
pre-processing tools.

### Clustering algorithms

* Fuzzy c-means:

### Regression

* Tikhonov regularized regression:


### Model selection:
* Compare estimators: Perform model selection through nested cross-validation,
  and determine the optimal model based on performance criteria.


### Pre-processing

* Split original feature data into training and test splits including
  standardization.
* Remove outliers based on minimum and maximum criteria of log error
  value.
* Standardize feature data by subtracting mean and dividing by the standard
  deviation.
* Transform data by label encoding.
* Replace NaN values by specified fill value or method.
* Remove features from dataset.
* Clone a dataset.

### Graphics

* Learning curve.
* Validation curve.
* Silhouette plot.
